[SetUp "1"]

1. d4 d5 2. Nc3 { Developing and defending the pawn.
This is the main line (and top engine move).
In practice it is only the second most popular on master games (the advance variation is the first) and third most popular on low-level games (the advance and the exchange variations are the first and second ones). } 2... dxe4 { So black simply takes } 3. Nxe4 Nf6 { That's another possible move. It is called the Tartakower Variation. It has in fact better odds (according to Lichess database) than the mainline. } (3... Bf5 { Getting the bishop out (allowing e6 without trapping it inside) } { [%cal Be7e6,Bf8b4] } 4. Ng3 { Going back and also attacking the bishop } { [%cal Bg3f5] } 4... Bg6 5. h4 { Intending to push forward and trap the bishop } { [%csl Rf5,Re4,Rd3][%cal Bh4h5,Rg3f5,Rg3e4,Rd1d3] } (5. Nf3 { This is in fact more common move on low-levels } 5... Nd7 { Black just develops naturally } 6. Bd3 { Here black can acctually ignore the threat and instead go on developing } (6. h4 { As seen in the mainline black must create a safe square for the bishop. } 6... h6 7. h5 Bh7) 6... e6 7. Bxg6 hxg6 { As black opens the h file he may consider casteling long (but castling short is still an option) } 8. Bf4) 5... h6 { Black must create a safe square for its bishop } 6. Nf3 { White next will try and challenge, again, the black bishop which is controlling a nice diagonal right now. By doing so he cuts the queen defend of the d pawn. Hence the knight first must come and defend it. } { [%cal Bf1d3,Rd8d4] } (6. h5 Bh7 7. Nf3 Qa5+ { The engine suggests this move but it is extremely rare (was played <100 times on Lichess and only once on master levels by non other than Tigran Petrosian) } 8. Bd2 Qc7) 6... Nd7 { Natural development } 7. h5 Bh7 8. Bd3 { Black must exchange bishops. This exchange is better for white as its bishop hasn't moved yet while black's bishop moved several times is has a nice location right now. } 8... Bxd3 9. Qxd3 e6 { Openning the way for the bishop and also preventing the g knight from jumping forward. } 10. Bd2 (10. Bf4 Qa5+ { Forcing white's knight to move twice in a raw } 11. Bd2 Bb4 { Creating a battery } 12. c3 Be7 { Retreating. The battery is gone and we moved the bishop twice but white's pawn structure is a bit less solid on the queen side (which is the one he, on alot of cases, intended castling). } 13. c4 Qc7 14. O-O-O Ngf6) 10... Ngf6 11. O-O-O Be7 12. Kb1 O-O 13. Ne4)  (3... Nd7 { This is the Karpov Variation. I will not dig into it but just be aware of the following nasty smothered mate: } 4. Qe2 { Say black continue developing naturally... } 4... Ngf6 5. Nd6# { Rather painful i'd say }) 4. Nxf6+ { Black is forced to take with one of the two pawn. The gxf6 option is as good as exf6 but it is trickier so we go with exf6. Allowing also the dark-squared bishop out. } { [%cal Bg7f6,Be7f6] } 4... exf6 5. Nf3 Bd6 6. Bd3 (6. Be2 O-O 7. O-O)  (6. Bc4 O-O 7. O-O Re8) 6... O-O 7. O-O { The odds now are in fact in black's favor! (the engine claims it is an equal position) } 7... Bg4 8. h3 Bh5 9. c3 { Here black can either develop his knight to d7, move his rook to e8 taking control of the e-file or move the queen to c7 creating a battery and threatening to check (after, for example, the light-squared bishop takes the defending knight) } { [%cal Bd8c7,Bf8e8,Bb8d7] } *
